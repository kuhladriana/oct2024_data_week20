The purpose of this analysis is to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk and  
identify the credit worthiness of its borrowers. A dataset was used from a peer to peer lending  
services company. The dataset included the loan size amount, interest rate, borrower income,  
total debt etc. From this dataset we were analyzing the “loan_status” column, where if the  
loan_status had a value of 0 it meant the loan was in a healthy standing, and a value of 1 meant  
the loan was at  risk of defaulting or risky. We needed to make a model that would try to predict  
whether the loan was healthy or at risk of defaulting.
